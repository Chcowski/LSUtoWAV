# LSU to WAV Ionverter.

This simple (simple!) utility converts all the LSU files in a directory
to wave files. LSUs are used largely by microcontrollers (especially 
lightsabers) and are raw 16 bit, mono, 44100Hz data. This utility just 
tacks on the WAV wrapper.

To use, download and place the lsuToWav.exe somewhere.
- Open up the command line.
- Change directory to your .LSU files.
- \path\to\exe\lsuToWav

The original lsu won't be changed. wav files will be created and 
placed in the same directory.
